129376    "\r\n\r\nTo be brutally honest, I didn't start with the intention of arguing it from a policy, short of the fact that the OP identified a POV issue with it.  My core argument is on the best organization of information on WP, which is something that policy is very loose on (the closest things being WP:N, WP:SIZE, and WP:SS/WP:SPINOUT).  Single articles covering several similar topics that may or may not be notable in a comparative fashion is better than having short or stub-like individual articles, while still allowing them to be searchable terms - but that's a point I argue without any policy to affirm or deny that approach, it's just a better practice for organization.   As soon as any arguments that used policy to back it up, I can't run on this argument alone and have to point out that our policies generally point in this direction but never spell it out, and that protracts the conversation when others say ""well, policy doesn't say that, therefore we don't have to do it.""  Add to the fact that it was a contentious topic, which is going to raise people's attitudes whenever even something close to ""Delete"" is mentioned, and they will fight tooth and nail, and alter the tone of the discussion. Yes, I'm wordy, and I had to repeat myself, but I felt my arguments were being twisted and/or were not clear. \r\nI still think there is a better way that's a win-win for everyone including the articles themselves, but others seem to outright refuse any change for improvement.
